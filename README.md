MaxCraft-MC-Toys
================
MaxCraft-MC-Toys is a repository of code I intend to write to learn how to code in java and code for Modded Minecraft.

Please do not knock my coding style at this time because I am a Amateur/Expert programmer in other languages and a
novice at Java.  I can and will learn; at my pace and style.  I am very adept at learning new programming languages
by looking at references and others examples.   If you see code here you like you can use it to the provisions of the
license..  I only ask that you reference me in your code and credits as a contributor.  I will, in turn, do the same
for code I find of others that end up here.  It is only fair.

If you wish to contribute, I prefer constructive contributions of knowledge to help me learn the language.
